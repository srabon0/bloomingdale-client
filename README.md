### EXPRESS


Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js

### NODE.JS

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browse.

# REACT ROUTER
React Router is a lightweight, fully-featured routing library for the React JavaScript library. React Router runs everywhere that React runs; on the web, on the server (using node.js), and on React Native.

# REACT FIREBASE HOOK

This library explores how React Hooks can work to make integration with Firebase even more straightforward than it already is. It takes inspiration for naming from RxFire and is based on an internal library that we had been using in a number of apps prior to the release of React Hooks. The implementation with hooks is 10x simpler than our previous implementation.
